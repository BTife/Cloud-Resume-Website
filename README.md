## Project Overview

This project showcases a cloud-native resume website built using AWS services. The site is delivered globally over HTTPS using a CDN and includes a serverless backend that tracks visitor traffic in real time.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate hands-on experience with:

* Cloud architecture
* Serverless computing
* Infrastructure configuration
* Secure and scalable deployment
